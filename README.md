## UX ##

MadaGuide has been designed with simplicity in mind to maximise the experience for all users.
MadaGuide is designed using the "mobile first" principle to ensure mobile users have a great experience. Considerations and changes were made to suit larger screens to again provide a great experience, while maximising the space available. Google Deveeloper tools were used at every stage to view the UX on mobile, tablet and larger screens.


## Colour Scheme ##

The colour scheme for MadaGuide is mostly neutral to ensure readability and accessibility, with pops of colour used to reflect the flag colours of Madagascar. The red and green colours of the Madagascar flag can be overpowering and their use has therefore been limited to splashes of colour to draw attention to certain features such as a call to action (CTA).

Colours used:

- **#000000** - for primary texts and header/footer
- **#ffffff** - for logo and page background 
- **#309135** - for main headings and styling e.g. box shadow
- **#c92d18** - for a call to action e.g. submit button on conttact us form 

## Typography ##

Two Google fonts were used for MadaGuide, both fonts are sans-serif without flourishes to provide style and functionality. Both fonts are widely regarded as accessible and look good.

Fonts used:

- **Lilita One** - for header logo
- **Nunito** - for all other text
- **Font Awesome** - a range of logos used to enhance headings, navigation and footer
